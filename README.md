# public-issues

Repository for tracking issues that are visible to the Route Views community.

# Provide Community Feedback

As a community member, we ask you to provide feedback in two ways:

1. React with üëç to **upvote** an issue, or
2. leave a **comment** with your notes, questions, or feedback.

> Ensure that your 'üëç upvote reaction' is in response to the description of the issue (aka the top-most comment).

# Ingesting Community Feedback

Route Views maintainers meet at a regular cadence to maintain our backlog.
We consider all community feedback as part of this process.

The following steps guide our review of community feedback.


1. Navigate to the [public-issues backlog Sorted by "üëç" reactions](https://github.com/routeviews/public-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).
    * Filter criteria: `is:issue is:open sort:reactions-+1-desc`
2. Navigate to the [public-issues backlog Sorted by interactions](https://github.com/routeviews/public-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Ainteractions)
    * Filter criteria: `is:issue is:open sort:interactions`
3. TODO, Once we have GitHub Enterprise (or if this repo becomes public), we can reflect on 'changes in the past week' using [Pulse](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/viewing-a-summary-of-repository-activity)
