# Voting

As a community member, we ask you to provide feedback in two ways:

1. React with 👍 to **upvote** an issue, or
2. leave a **comment** with your notes, questions, or feedback.

> Ensure that your "👍" (upvote reaction) is in response to the **description** of the issue (aka the *top-most comment*).

# Reviewing Votes

> Route Views maintainers meet at a weekly cadence to maintain our backlog.
> We consider all community feedback as part of this process.
